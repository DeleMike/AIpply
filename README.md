AIpply is an open-source Go backend service designed to streamline job applications. It serves as a REST API that harnesses Google Gemini AI to create customized CVs, cover letters, and interview questions based on job descriptions and your personal responses. Whether you're a job seeker looking to save time or a developer interested in AI-driven tools, AIpply helps you stand out with professional, tailored documents.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Personalized Document Generation**: Automatically creates CVs and cover letters that align your experience with job requirements.
- **Interview Prep**: Generates relevant, conversational questions based on the job description and your experience level.
- **Powerful Prompts**: Uses role-based prompting strategies for high-quality, actionable outputs.
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitors generation counts via Redis for usage insights.
- **Clean HTML Outputs**: Returns styled-ready HTML fragments for easy frontend integration.
- **Extensible API**: Built with Gin for fast, reliable REST endpoints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Core:** Go (Golang)
* **API/Routing:** Gin-Gonic
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini (via `google.golang.org/genai`), specifically using `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-2.5-flash`
* **Database (Metrics):** Redis (for tracking generation counts)
* **Configuration:** From `config-example.yaml`

## üîç How It Works

AIpply sends structured, role-based prompts to Google Gemini to generate personalized CVs, cover letters, and interview questions.
The model responses are returned as clean HTML fragments for the frontend to render.


## üîå API Endpoints

All routes are versioned under the `/api/v1` prefix.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/` | Health check route. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/generate-questions` | Generates interview questions from a job description and experience level. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/generate-cv` | Generates a full CV in HTML format based on a job description and a JSON array of Q&A pairs. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/generate-cover-letter` | Generates a cover letter in HTML format based on a job description and a JSON array of Q&A pairs. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/metrics` | Retrieves generation metrics (CV/Cover Letter counts) from Redis. |

### Request Body Examples

**`POST /generate-questions`**
```json
{
  "jobDescription": "Looking for a junior Go developer...",
  "experienceLevel": "Just Getting Started"
}
```

**`POST /generate-cv`** or **`POST /generate-cover-letter`**

```json
{
  "jobDescription": "Looking for a senior Go developer...",
  "answers": [
    {
      "question": "First, what is your full name, email address, and phone number?",
      "answer": "Jane Doe, jane.doe@email.com, 123-456-7890"
    },
    {
      "question": "Briefly describe your relevant experience.",
      "answer": "Senior Dev at TechCorp, 2020-2023. I led the backend team..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìñ Usage

To interact with the API, you can use tools like curl, Postman, or integrate it into your application. Here are some curl examples assuming the server is running on `localhost:8080`:

- **Health Check**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5050/
  ```

- **Generate Interview Questions**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/v1/generate-questions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"job_description": "Senior Go Developer role focused on backend services.", "experience_level": "Senior (5+ years)"}'
  ```

- **Generate CV**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/v1/generate-cv \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"job_description": "Senior Go Developer...", "answers": [{"question": "Your name?", "answer": "Jane Doe"}]}'
  ```

- **Get Metrics**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5050/api/v1/metrics
  ```

For more advanced usage, consider wrapping the API in a frontend or scripting it for batch processing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Go (1.21 or later recommended)
  * A running Redis instance (check the [Docker](docker-compose.yaml) file)
  * A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DeleMike/AIpply.git
    cd AIpply
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Configure the application:**

    Create a `config.yaml` file in the root directory, or set the environment variables listed in the table above.

    ```bash
    # Copy the example configuration file
    cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
    ```

    Then open `config.yaml` and fill in your own settings:

    ```yaml
    # config.yaml
    api_key: "your-gemini-api-key"
    
    server:
      port: 8080
      gin_mode: "debug"  # Use "release" in production
    
    redis:
      addr: "localhost:6379"
      password: ""
      db: 0
    ```

    > **üí° Tip:** Keep your API keys private and never commit them to version control. Add `config.yaml` to your `.gitignore` file. Environment variables can override any config value and take precedence over `config.yaml` settings.

4.  **Run the server:**

    ```sh
    go run .
    ```

    The server will start on the port you configured.

## üß™ Testing & Linting

  * **Run all tests:**

    ```sh
    go test ./...
    ```

  * **Run the linter (Revive):**

    ```sh
    # Install revive if you haven't
    go install github.com/mgechev/revive@latest

    # Run from the root directory
    revive -config revive.toml ./...
    ```
